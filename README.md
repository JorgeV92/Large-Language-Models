## Introduction
This project is dedicated to reviewing, experimenting with, and analyzing large language models (LLMs), alongside open-source and popular academic papers in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Specifically, the project focuses on:

- Analyzing research papers on ML/DL and large language models, including both seminal and state-of-the-art works.  
- Exploring open-source models and their implementations to understand design choices, performance, and trade-offs.  
- Implementing and experimenting with model code in **Python**, leveraging **PyTorch** and **scikit-learn**, and integrating performance-critical kernels in **CUDA C++**.

This repository serves as both a research exploration platform and an educational resource for anyone interested in advanced topics in large language models.

## Features
- **Paper Reviews**: Summaries and critiques of notable ML, DL, and LLM research papers.  
- **Model Implementations**: Example implementations and experiments with large language models, focusing on open-source repositories.  
- **Experimental Code**:  
  - **Python** scripts using **PyTorch** for model training and inference.  
  - **scikit-learn** for classical ML baselines or preprocessing tasks.  
  - **CUDA C++** kernels for performance-critical components.  
- **Reproducible Experiments**: Tutorials and Jupyter notebooks to help others reproduce experiments and understand best practices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/LLM-Project.git
   cd LLM-Project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **CUDA setup** (if you plan to compile CUDA kernels):  
   - Ensure you have [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installed.  
   - Verify CUDA installation:
     ```bash
     nvcc --version
     ```

5. **Compile CUDA code** (if needed):  
   ```bash
   cd src/cpp/cuda
   nvcc -o custom_kernel custom_kernel.cu
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Run Python scripts**  
   ```bash
   python src/python/train.py --config configs/transformer_config.yaml
   ```

2. **Run notebooks**  
   - Launch Jupyter or JupyterLab:
     ```bash
     jupyter lab
     ```
   - Open the desired `.ipynb` file from the `notebooks/` directory.

3. **Reviewing Papers**  
   - Navigate to `docs/paper_reviews/` to explore summaries, reviews, and discussions of various ML, DL, and LLM papers.

4. **Implementing or Extending CUDA Kernels**  
   - Make modifications in `src/cpp/cuda/custom_kernel.cu` or add new `.cu` files for specialized GPU operations.  
   - Recompile if you make changes:
     ```bash
     nvcc -o custom_kernel custom_kernel.cu
     ```
